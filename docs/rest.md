## OpenAPI specification

Machine-readable OpenAPI spec is hosted on `/docs/.json`, derived from [this](../src/web/server/.openapi.yaml) `.yaml` file.

Human-readable interactive documentation based on this spec is hosted on `/docs`

Writing an OpenAPI spec has a number of advantages:

- Code generation
- Tooling for documentation, tests and mocks
- Machine-readability
- Stability

# `frog-db` REST API
